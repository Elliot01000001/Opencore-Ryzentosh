You have to download the macOS installer. YOU NEED TO HAVE OPENCORE for this (Opencore Download --> https://github.com/acidanthera/opencorepkg/releases)

You can do it by the guide given above


macOS --> https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/installer-guide/mac-install.html#downloading-macos-modern-os


Windows --> https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/installer-guide/winblows-install.html#downloading-macos


Linux --> https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/installer-guide/linux-install.html#downloading-macos

You could also use GibMacOS --> https://github.com/corpnewt/gibMacOS

Or any other distors like Niresh, etc... (https://community.hackintoshshop.com/files/category/6-hackintosh-installer/)

I personally prefer Olarila as it is the *The Real Vanilla Hackintosh* --> https://www.olarila.com/

It obviously depends upon your personal preferences, go with what you are comfortable with

Finally, please read the README.md as it is really Important, it has all the information you need

Good Luck and God Bless
